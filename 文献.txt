Predicting Customers' Behavior in E-commerce using Multilayer Perceptron




Predicting the occurrence of commodity purchase is helpful for electricity supplier to achieve a good product recommendation [6]. This paper presents the application of multilayer perceptron for predicting users' purchase behaviors on e-commerce websites. The model is built by learning from user's history data and behaviors at present. The data we use is a four months of data provided by Alibaba, the largest online shopping marketplace in China. Compared to classical three-layer multilayer perceptron model, the model we use here is a deep network with more hidden layers. The performance of our multilayer model is verified to be better than traditional methods do, especially in five-layered multilayer model.
